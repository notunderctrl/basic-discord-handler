# Basic Discord Bot + Command & Event Handler

Steps to get your bot up and running.

- Clone this repo
- Add your bot token in `.env`
- Change the settings in `config.json` to your likings (you can leave out the guildId if you want to register your commands globally - this can take up to an hour)
- Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install all the packages
- Run using `node src/index.js`
