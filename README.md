## ü™ú Steps to get your bot up and running.

- Clone this repo
- Add your bot token in `.env`
- Change the settings in `config.json` to your likings (you can leave out the guildId if you want to register your commands globally - this can take up to an hour)
- Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install all the packages
- Run using `node src/index.js`

## üßæ Commands + Events information

To get more information on how a command/event is created/structured, open the respective folder and check its README.md file.
